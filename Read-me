1. Create a new notepad file;
2. Paste the contents of the "Vault Creator" and save it as a .bat;
3. Replace the two "PASSWORDHERE" with your desired password and you are good to go!;
4. Place the batch file inside any folder (Doesn't works with the Desktop);
5. Execute it;
6. Paste the files you want to hide inside the folder named "Vault" that was created when you executed the batch;
7. Execute the batch again to hide the "Vault" folder;
8. If you want to see your stuff again execute the batch, write your password and the folder will appear again.

WARNING: BEFORE DELETING ANY FOLDER MAKE SURE YOU TOOK EVERYTHING INSIDE OF IT! NO PROBLEM IF YOU DELETE THE BATCH,
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PLACE A NEW ONE INSIDE THE FOLDER THAT YOUR OLD BATCH WAS TO RECLAIM YOUR STUFF.
