Replace the two "PASSWORDHERE" with your desired password and you are good to go!

1. Place the batch file inside any folder (Doesn't works with the Desktop);
2. Execute it.
3. Paste the files you want to hide inside the folder named "Vault" that was created when you executed the batch;
4. Execute the batch again to hide the "Vault" folder.
5. If you want to see your stuff again execute the batch, write your password and the folder will appear again.

WARNING: BEFORE DELETING ANY FOLDER MAKE SURE YOU TOOK EVERYTHING INSIDE OF IT! NO PROBLEM IF YOU DELETE THE BATCH,
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PLACE A NEW ONE INSIDE THE FOLDER THAT YOUR OLD BATCH WAS TO RECLAIM YOUR STUFF.
